**Understanding Cloud Concepts**

**What is the Cloud**
- is a global network of servers around the worls acting as one hard drive.
- Signing onto your gmail account, watching a show on Netflix or opening a file on Dropbox, you are using the cloud
- Before the cloud, you might have been backing up you photos or music on a CDROM or your PC's hard drive
- files are sent to servers and apple's data center around the world. you might lose your phone but that will be available

**Cloud Computing Characteristics**

**On-Demand Self-Service**
- Consumers can provision resources as needed and automatically. Cloud services consumers can provision services on an as-needed basis, without the need to work with the CSP (Cloud service provider) directly.
- The consumer can expand (or reduce) these services without the need for human assistance from the CSP.

**Broad Network Access**
- Services are available across the network from commonly available clients
- Client devices and traditional server deployments are able to access cloud-based resources across the network.
- The network might include the local on-premises network or the Internet, or both.

**Resource Pooling**
- The cloud service provider (CSP) pools resources in a multitenant model and adjusts resource allocation on an on-demand basis, and the specific distribution of hardware resources is abstracted from the consumer
